# Calculator

 📝 About
This is a simple web-based calculator built using the Django web framework. It showcases the fundamental concepts of web development with Django, including views, forms, URL routing, and template rendering. The interface allows users to input numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations.

 🛠️ What It Does
* Accepts two numerical inputs from the user
* Lets the user select an operation:
  ➕ Addition, ➖ Subtraction, ✖️ Multiplication, ➗ Division
* Processes the operation on the backend using Django views
* Displays the result on a separate result page using templates

 📌 Uses
* Educational tool to understand Django basics
* Quick-start project for beginners learning form handling in Django
* Template for simple interactive web apps
* Great base for extending into more complex tools (scientific calculator, history tracking, etc.)

🎯 Why I Made It
As a student exploring web development, I wanted to create a real-world mini-project to strengthen my understanding of:
* Handling POST/GET requests
* Dynamic form submission
* Page redirection and result rendering in Django
  This project also serves as a foundation for future projects involving user input and logic-based responses.
