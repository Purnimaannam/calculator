## 🎯 Why I Made This

As a student exploring web development, I wanted to build a real-world mini-project to strengthen my understanding of:

- Handling POST/GET requests  
- Dynamic form submission  
- Page redirection and template rendering in Django  

This project also serves as a foundation for future logic-based applications that involve user input.
